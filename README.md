# üè† The Odin Project: Homepage Project

This project is a homepage created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum that I fully personalized and turned into my portfolio. It serves as an exercise in building a foundational web page using HTML and CSS, with a focus on layout, semantic structure, and responsive design.

## Live Demo

- **Interactive Elements:** The page includes subtle animations and micro-interactions to provide a more engaging user experience.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Users can switch between a light and dark theme, showcasing the use of CSS variables and JavaScript for a personalized viewing experience.
